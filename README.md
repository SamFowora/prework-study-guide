# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage serves as an easy-to-access page that gives pointers about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git to people who are new to the web development environment (like myself).
My motivation for creating this was to generally acquire some ground knowledge on the tech sector. In this day and age where everything is becoming tech based and the need for cybersecurity is more prevalent than ever, it's only right that everyone should understand the bare basics of web dev and how to keep themselves safe on the internet. Although this webpage does not go into that much detail on the cybersec side of things, this does give a perspective into the inner workings of a website - wwhich is something we inevitably use every single day.
I have learnt a lot from making this website, but one thing which really stood out was how the three layers of HTML, CSS and JS work together, as well as the fact that the languages used for them are not Wone size fits all". Another thing I have learned is what GitHub is and how to use the command prompt with GitBash.

## Usage

The study guide is very easy to use. Each section has notes on HTML, CSS, JS and Git (not to be confused with the derogatory word) and these notes contain bits of information that I found useful to know, especially as a beginner. If you click CTRL+Shift+I, ChromeDevTools will open and you will be able to see the Javascript running. When opened you will see a list of topics learned from the prework and there will be a suggested topic for you to study first.
